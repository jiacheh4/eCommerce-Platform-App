	then open -> view -> developer -> developer tools
	
	Console tab to see what the error is 
	
	Sources tab->pause icon-> to highlight the line where exception occurs
	
	Watch -> to see what the value of variable is
			
	Breakpoints -> to pause the execution and open chrome debugger
		   
Debug on VSCode:

	make sure attach the packager to port 8081 (VSCode->preferences->setting->User(search: react-native.packager.port)

Useful APIs /Documentations:

	www.reactnative.dev/docs -> API -> Core Components
